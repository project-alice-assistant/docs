## Which way?

We have two ways of installing Alice for now, well, three, if you count Docker. As of october 2020 the prefered install method is manual setup, as fabricating an image to burn on your SD everytime we push a new version is time-consuming and error prone. We will resume image creation when version 1 is released.

- [Manual setup](manual-install)
- [Prefabricated Raspbian image](image-install)
- [Docker](docker)
